      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Heart & Bloom began in 2022 as a passion project in a small home kitchen.
        What started with experimenting with natural oils and botanicals quickly grew
        into a full-time dedication to creating beautiful, nourishing soaps.
        Each bar is made by hand with love, care, and a commitment to sustainability.
