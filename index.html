    <p>
      At <strong>Heart & Bloom</strong>, we believe self-care should be simple, gentle, and full of heart.
      Our soaps are handcrafted in small batches using natural ingredients, botanical oils,
      and scents inspired by the beauty of everyday life.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Heart & Bloom began as a small kitchen experiment and quickly blossomed into a passion for
      crafting soap that feels as good as it looks. What started with a few bars made for friends
      has grown into a small-batch business dedicated to kindness — to your skin and the planet.
